Welcome to the Rocks Source Tree.

******************** CAUTION *********************** 
Building Rocks from source is 
	(a) Time consuming
	(b) Invasive. A great deal of software will be added to to 
	    your build host.  There are literally 100+ packages that are
            needed to build the 300+ RPMs of a full build
	(c) Space consuming. At least 40GB of free space

I. Tested Build Environments
There are two tested methods of building Rocks
	1) On a CentOS system without Rocks
	2) On a Rocks Development Appliance

II. Setup
A. Download the full source tree
	To download all the Rocks source code use the ./init.sh script 
	in this repo. It cycles through all the required subrepo and 
	download them automatically.
	(for more info run ./init.sh -h)
B. Update OS Mirror location
	One of the primary reasons that so much disk space is needed 
	is because the complete CentOS distribution and updates 
	are mirrored, then built as DVD images, and finally added to 
	the local distribution (3 copies).  Disk space is cheap.  

	Having a mirror that is close to you (network distance) makes 
	the mirroring process much quicker.  The file
        	src/roll/base/OSROLL/version.mk 
	contains a line 
		MIRRORURL=http://mirror.hmc.edu

	(a) Edit the above file to specify a mirror closer to you
	(b) The environment variable WORKDIR controls where the 
	mirror is created. If WORKDIR does not exist, /tmp is used. 

IIIa.  Bootstrapping a CentOS system without Rocks
	Rocks needs Rocks to build completely. In particular, the 
	Rocks database has to be set up properly. The steps to perform 
	this are as follows: 

	(a) Install CentOS as a Desktop Workstation
	(b) Download Rocks Source code. 
	(c) cd src/roll/base
	(d) ./bootstrap0.sh < /dev/null &> /tmp/bootstrap0.sh.out

	Inspect the the last few hundred lines of /tmp/bootstrap0.sh.out,
	You should see yum install a large number of packages.
        
	(e) Log out. Log back in, to make sure that newly installed /etc/profile	scripts have been sourced.

OR

IIIb.  Bootstrapping a Development Appliance 
	Rocks needs Rocks to build completely. 
	Most of the prerequisites are already on a Develeopment Appliance,
	but further prep is needed to build rocks.
	The steps to perform this are as follows: 

	(a) Install CentOS as a Desktop Workstation
	(b) Download Rocks Source code. 
	(c) cd src/roll/base
	(d) ./prepdevel.sh < /dev/null &> /tmp/prepdevel.sh.out

	Inspect the the last few hundred lines of /tmp/prepdevel.sh.out,
	You should see yum install a large number of packages.
        
	(e) Log out. Log back in, to make sure that newly installed /etc/profile	scripts have been sourced. In particular, /etc/profile.d/rocks-binaries.sh

IV.  Results of Bootstrap
	If things have worked well, then
	# rocks list roll
	Output should look similar to the following:
# rocks list roll
NAME                VERSION    ARCH   ENABLED
CentOS:             5.8        x86_64 yes    
Updates-CentOS-5.8: 2012-04-17 x86_64 yes 

	Notice that the Updates Roll should have the date on which bootsrapped. 

V.  Building Rocks
	The primary driving script to build all of Rocks is builder.sh.
	The Order in which rolls are built is critical, both the base roll and
	kernel rolls need to be built and part of the local distribution before
	any other rolls have been built.  If for some reason, the base and/or
	kernel rolls do not build, the build will abort.

	# ./builder.sh < /dev/null &> /tmp/builder.sh.out &

	Each Roll will have the output of its build stored in 
	# /tmp/clean-<roll>.out    (Output of make clean)
	# /tmp/make-<roll>-bootstrap.out  (Output of Bootstrap.sh for each roll)
	# /tmp/make-<roll>-roll.out  (Output of Roll build)
	# /tmp/build-<roll>.out (Summary of Roll Build, Inventory of RPMs)


VI. Example build-<roll>.out output.
The log files for a particular build of the HPC roll  
# ls -l /tmp/*hpc*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1142 Apr 17 07:40 /tmp/build-hpc.out
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   22530 Apr 17 06:41 /tmp/clean-hpc.out
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3201581 Apr 17 07:03 /tmp/make-hpc-bootstrap.out
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4050886 Apr 17 07:40 /tmp/make-hpc-roll.out

An Example (Successful) Build of the HPC roll (/tmp/build-hpc.out) looks like

VII. One step, build it all on a CentOS Desktop Workstation
The following should build all of Rocks without explictly requiring one to logout/login after the initial bootstrap.sh

# (cd src/roll/base; ./bootstrap0.sh &> /tmp/bootstrap0.sh.out < /dev/null; cd ../../..; . /etc/profile.d/rocks-binaries.sh; ./builder.sh &> /tmp/builder.sh.out < /dev/null ) &
